mean time of arrests of Whistleblowers per news organization

## Why this?
To evaluate the trustworthyness of investigative journalism and which outlets to trust, it is vital to see which ones do snitch on their sources and which don't.
#### It is vital to provide potential whistleblowers, leakers and informants with data so that they can make an informed decision to which media [organization] they want to submit their material to.


## How?
#### Datajournalism!
By collecting as much datapoints upon investigative journalism across pubishers/media outlets and cases, the more granular the result should be.
#### In short, we should see a normal distribution globally as well as per nation/media outlet and type ofsource material.
